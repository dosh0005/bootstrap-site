                        <h2>Why we need 100% renewable energy</h2>

                        <p>Burning fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — is causing climate change, making us sick, and destroying the lands and oceans we love.
                        </p>
                        <p>We must completely stop using these dirty and polluting fuels and rapidly shift the planet to energy provided entirely by the sun, wind, and other clean, safe renewable sources.
                        </p>
                        <p>We know we can do it. Greenpeace's well-known and respected Energy [R]evolution analysis shows a 100 percent renewable energy future is possible.
                        </p>
                        <h2>An efficient, smart energy future</h2>

                        <p>To get to 100 percent renewable energy, we'll also need to do more with less. Greenpeace’s philosophy on energy efficiency is all about intelligent use, to squeeze more out of every bit of energy.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Sustainable, renewable transport to cut out oil</h2>

                        <p>Today about one-quarter of the world’s energy — almost all of it oil products — is used to power transport by road, rail, air and sea. A shift to renewably powered, smart transport is essential to reach our 100 percent renewable energy future.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Renewably powered internet</h2>

                        <p>As more of our economy shifts online, it’s critical to power the internet with renewable energy. We — as informed digital citizens — have the power to demand IT move away from dirty energy sources, and embrace clean, renewable energy instead. The good news is the shift has already begun; find out how!
                        </p>
                        <h2>Let's finance the future we all want</h2>

                        <p>Today, the flow of money to fossil fuel and nuclear projects stands in the way of a clean, safe and secure future for all. Greenpeace's work on finance strives to ensure investors avoid or withdraw from risky, polluting coal mining and oil drilling projects. Instead, we support investment in the secure, clean renewable energy future we all want.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Support climate-friendly refrigeration solutions</h2>

                        <p>F-gases (fluorine gases) are a serious threat to our climate. These synthetic chemicals used to cool our drinks, food, cars, supermarkets and office buildings are extremely potent greenhouse gases. Greenpeace is working to phase them out completely and promote climate-friendly refrigeration solutions.
                        </p>
                        <h2>All we need is political action</h2>

                        <p>Every year more scientists, engineers and activists agree 100 percent renewable energy is not only achievable, it's essential. The barriers holding us back are purely political — not technical or economic. Find out about Greenpeace campaigns for climate solutions in your country and our work to support global agreements for climate action.
                        </p>
                        <h2>False solutions we must avoid</h2>

                        <p>Nuclear power is dangerous, polluting and expensive. Greenpeace was born out of protests to halt nuclear weapons testing, and we've been fighting nuclear weapons and nuclear power ever since. Carbon capture and storage is another false solution to climate change. This costly and unproven technology could undermine efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions. It also diverts precious public funding and investment away from clean, safe renewable energy.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What can you do?</h2>

                        <p>Climate change is a huge global problem, but you can still take important steps to tackle it in your daily life. Choose solutions to suit your lifestyle and your home. You'll save money, energy and time, and make your home more healthy and comfortable.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Corporations urge action on climate change</h2>
                        <p>In January 2007 a group of U.S.-based businesses called on the federal government to quickly enact strong national legislation to achieve significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The group said any delay in action to control emissions increases the risk of unavoidable consequences that could necessitate even steeper reductions in the future. The alliance of businesses and environmental groups, called the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, includes Alcoa, BP America, Caterpillar, Duke Energy, DuPont, FPL Group, General Electric, Lehman Brothers, PG&E, and PNM Resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>In November 2006, in Canada, the heads of Alcan, Bombardier, Shell Canada, Falconbridge, Home Depot Canada and Desjardins Group wrote a letter to the Prime Minister in which they stated "the world must act urgently to stabilize the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and minimize the global impacts of climate change."
